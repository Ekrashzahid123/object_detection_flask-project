ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project: a real-time object detection web app built with Flask and powered by the cutting-edge TensorFlow.js COCO-SSD model!

The COCO-SSD model is a fast, accurate pre-trained deep learning model that detects everyday objectsâ€”like people, bottles, and carsâ€”in real time right in your browser.

By running this model client-side, the app performs live object detection using just your webcam, eliminating heavy backend processing and enabling a smooth, responsive experience.

This project shows how advanced AI models are making real-time computer vision practical and accessible for web applications.
